#   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

#   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
# to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
# state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
# the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
